## Image Script

The Image Script was originally a complex C++ piece of code to generate menus and imagemaps for Audacity.

It has largely been superseded by WIT and built in enhancements to scripting within Audacity. 

* Toolbars, EAGs and Preferences can be captured manually from within Audacity using the screenshot dialog.
** It does the work of launching and capturing each in turn.
** This can also be driven from an external script.
* Menus, annotated toolbar images and their imagemaps are now captured from WIT
** Use the [Special] button and follow instructions from there.
** The configuration files live in the wiki.
* Track images showing clips, envelopes etc, are now captured with the python test script.
