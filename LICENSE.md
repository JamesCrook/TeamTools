# License

License varies from tool to tool, see source code.  Beware that libraries
may have different licenses to the code that uses them.

Where the license is not specified **ASK**. Assume all allowable rights 
reserved otherwise.

Documentation is usually **CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0** (attribution, non-commercial, 
share alike)  In particular non-commercial implies you may not post 
advertising on the same pages as documentation.  I want documentation 
derived from my work to be ad-free.

Code is usually **MIT license**.  The tools have more value the more people use 
and adapt them.
