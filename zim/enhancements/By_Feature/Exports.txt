Export multiple is much more complete than export as a scriptable command is.  We'd like to add flexibility to select the format and sample rate in the scriptable command.  We want to be able to do Export-Multiple as a macro with a number of steps.  Why?  So we can add additional steps like noise removal and compression into an exporting macro.

//There is actually already a proposal for a more capable export command.//

Format selection GUI is messy.  This is especially so for the catch alls like 'other uncompressed formats' which has many compressed formats in it.  

As a short term measure we could change the wording to be more accurate.
	[ ] Use 'more formats' as the text for 'other uncompressed formats' @tweak

The scriptable export command will be using the same format specification 'panels' as export and export multiple do.  Note also that these are rather similar to settings for effects.  Most likely any big improvement to export setings GUI will follow from improvements to effects GUIs. 

==== Stop! ====

[ ] Stop in export multiple should stop the export, not just skip over the current export.  @inconsistency @tweak
