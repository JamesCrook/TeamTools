One point raised is that finding the actual clipping for a mix would be time consuming. However, high risk of clipping can be computed rapidly.  It will get a false positive for mixing sound and anti-sound, but in nearly all real world use it will be correct.  We could also have three ratings:

* No risk of clipping (maxes add to less than 1)
* Definitely clips (clipping likely, and confirmed in one block)
* Risk of clipping (clipping likely, but of 10 risky blocks tested, none did, due to anti-sound)

I think it is worthwhile having a display of the mix - which can be used for navigation - and is shown whenever exporting.  This will also sometimes help with muted tracks:

[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1334|1334]] Enh: No warning is provided that if some tracks are muted they are not exported. (P4, with 8 comments)

It will help where the tracks are two speakers, because it will be clear from the mix that there are periods of silence, if one speaker is muted.
