====== Inconsistencies ======
Created Monday 03 June 2019

Inconsistencies are generally behaviours we'd expect based on what else Audacity does, and be surprised by.

Inconsistent features may sometimes be easier fixes.  There should already be code in Audacity that 'does what we want' and the inconsistency is that we don't use it in this case.

==== Inconsistencies ====

==== Spectral Selection ====
[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=917|917]] Enh: Spectral Selection only enabled for spectral edit effects. (P3, with 11 comments)

If you have a spectral selection, you ought to be able to apply an effect - such as amplify - to it.  Like, if I pick out a phone trill in the spectrogram, I want to be able to amplify it, echo it etc without affecting the other sounds.  I dislike greying out.  Users easily get bewildered as to why items are greyed out, and if there is a lot of greying out it means a lot of inactive and therefore space wasting UI.

Since we do have spectral only effects in Audacity, a good way to "fix" the problem would be to provide a GUI with ordinary slider controls for low-high frequencies, if the effect is called without a spectral selection.

==== GUI Improvement ====
[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598|1598]] Enh: Improve GUI for Screenshot Tools (P4, with 1 comments)

Note that the Scriptables menu has a compact version already.  We should embed that as a 'panel' in this GUI.
