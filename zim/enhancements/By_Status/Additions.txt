Featurey enhancement requests are nice-to-haves, and arguably never belonged in Bugzilla.  

=== Compressor ===
[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153|153]] Enh: Compressor usability enhancements (P4, with 4 comments)

* Stereo processing makes sense when channels differ.  We are doing dual mono.
* Grid lines perhaps should be done at same time as grid lines on waveform.
* Positioning is 'a tweak'.

==== Optimisation / Other Windows ====
[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=492|492]] Add mixed-radix-fft implementation with menu item to adjust spectrogram window (P4, with 6 comments)

This is a geek-driven enh request and P4 is a bit high.

==== Straight Feature Request ====
[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1987|1987]] Enh: Export button on History Dialog (P4, with 2 comments)

Sure, this is a nice-to-have.
