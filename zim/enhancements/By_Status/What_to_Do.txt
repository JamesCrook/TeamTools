====== What to Do ======
Created Monday 03 June 2019

It is not clear what to do for these.

==== Mouse-following menu items ====
[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1638|1638]] Enh: Some Ext- menu items depend on mouse position (P4, with 2 comments)

It is not clear how they should be handled.  Just drop thm from the menu?


==== HOME key versus H-O-M-E ====
[ ] [[https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744|744]] Enh: Keyboard preferences hotkey search - unwanted results (P5, with 13 comments)

It isn't clear how to handle the user who types the name of a key in full, rather than pressing the key.
