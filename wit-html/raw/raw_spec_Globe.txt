__NOTOC__

Interactive diagrams are programs.  This is the program structure for the interactive diagram which shows climate regions:

<pre>
DISPLAY_FOCUS_DETAIL Focus=SmallCircle
  IMAGE_WITH_HOTSPOTS
</pre>

This interactive diagram uses the same image for both the displayed image and the hotspots - since the chart already is using colour to designate zones.

The original image has slight variations in colour, so the program rounds colour values to the nearest multiple of 5.  Even so, the 'Humid Continental' region in Iran is in 4 different colours.  The workaround is to create multiple tips.  However, it would be better and simpler to correct the original image source.

There's a stand-alone [https://wit.audacityteam.org/imagemap2_test
.htm?page=Globe interactive demo] but here is the result in wiki:
