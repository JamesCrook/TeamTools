__NOTOC__

Interactive diagrams are programs.  This is the program structure for the interactive diagram which shows the structure of the Ear:

The specification above builds a simple focus-detail display.

The detailed data for the regions, buttons and tooltips follows.

The three buttons at the top of the page act when you hover on them.  The three corresponding regions defined next act when you click on them.

<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_cartilage Elastic Cartilages]</h1>
<em><p>Elastic cartilage holds the shape of the outer ear.  The shape of the outer ear is important, as it helps collect sounds and aids in determining direction of sound.  Bone would be brittle and at risk of being broken.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,20,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles Auditory Ossicles]</h1>
<em><p>The ossicles are tiny bones that transmit sound from the tympanic membrane to the oval window.  Muscles can tighten and slacken so as to make this system for transmitting sound more or less sensitive.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,30,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal Semicircular Canals]</h1>
<em><p>The semicircular canals are concerned with balance and equilibrium</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,40,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_of_the_ear Vestibule]</h1>
<em><p>The vestibule of the ear is also concerned with balance and equilibrium.  Like the cochlea, it contains 'hair cells' which are sensitive to motion.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,50,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_nerve Auditory Nerve]</h1>
<em><p>The auditory nerves conduct signals from the ears to the brain.  There is also auditory processing in the nerves.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,60,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea Cochlea]</h1>
<em><p>The Cochlea is a spiral shaped organ that has standing waves of sound in it.  The spiral shape is relevant to its ability to sensitively sense different frequencies of sound.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,70,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Window Round Window]</h1><em><p>The round window helps in equalising the pressure of the fluid in the inner ear.  It moves outwards as the oval window is pushed in, and vice versa.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,80,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube Auditory Tube]</h1><em><p>The Auditory tube equalises pressure between the inside and outside of the ear.  This is related to the sensation of 'ears popping' when flying.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,90,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_window Oval Window]</h1><em><p>The oval window is a membrane that transmits vibrations in the ossicles to the fluid in the inner ear.  It is oval rather than round, so that it transmits all relevant frequencies.  Were it round there would be characteristic frequencies that it absorbed more than others.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,100,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanic_cavity Tympanic Cavity]</h1><em><p>The Tympanic Cavity is an air filled region of the inner ear</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,110,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum Tympanic Membrane]</h1><em><p>The Tympanic membrane or ear drum converts vibrations of sound in air to vibrations of the ossicles</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,120,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal External Acoustic Meatus]</h1><em><p>The ear canal brings sound to the middle ear.  The inner structures of the ear are housed in a bony compartment, whereas the outer ear is outside the skull and uses cartilage to hold its shape.</p></em>

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(0,20,130,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auricle_(anatomy) Auricle]</h1><em><p>The auricle is the outermost part of the ear</p></em>

There are two zones that 'do the same' as the labels.

<pre>ZONE:RGBA=(133,95,255,255);TIP=</pre>
<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal Ear Canal]</h1><em><p>The ear canal <em>(external acoustic meatus)</em> brings sound to the middle ear.  The inner structures of the ear are housed in a bony compartment, whereas the outer ear is outside the skull and uses cartilage to hold its shape.</p></em>
