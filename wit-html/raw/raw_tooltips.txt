{{intro|1=This is used with [http://wit.audacityteam.org wit.audacityteam.org] so that we can modify tooltips for menu items.|2=}}

* The '''key''' is the name of the menu item.
* next there is a '''short''' tooltip.  Do NOT use wiki mark up in this.
** These are used in the menu image maps
* next there is a '''long''' tooltip.  It is OK to use wiki mark up in this.
** These are used in the table of shortcuts.
** If these start with a + they are added to the end of the short version.
** Items like 'File' which have a submenu produce a comment above that group.

This table is made more complex by the need to 'escape' certain symbols that have special meanings.  In particular if you want a " in a tooltip, you must use \"
