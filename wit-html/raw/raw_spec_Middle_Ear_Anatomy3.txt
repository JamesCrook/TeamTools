This is the spec for the interactive diagram which shows the structure of the Middle Ear:

<pre>
DISPLAY_FOCUS_DETAIL Focus=SmallCircle
  BUTTON_ROW
  IMAGE_WITH_HOTSPOTS
</pre>

The specification above builds a simple focus-detail display.  There's an [https://wit.audacityteam.org/imagemap2_test.htm?page=The_Ear interactive demo].

This is one of three related pages.  The other two are:
<ul>
<li>[https://wit.audacityteam.org/imagemap2_test.htm?page=The_Ear The Ear] [[Toolbox/The_Ear|spec]]
<li>[https://wit.audacityteam.org/imagemap2_test.htm?page=Inner_Ear_Anatomy Inner Ear] [[Toolbox/Inner_Ear_Anatomy|spec]]
</ul>

The detailed data for the regions, buttons and tooltips follows.
