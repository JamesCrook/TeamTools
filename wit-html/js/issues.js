Even if the Audacity recording slider is available, the sound device may not support Audacity adjusting its   system playback or recording sliders. To control loopback recording on those systems, try adjusting the playback level of the audio player.\n**  On many other devices, the Audacity recording and playback volume sliders will be \"linked\" together when loopback recording with playback and recording device set to the same device. Adjusting either slider will often adjust the sound you hear without affecting the achieved recording level, enabling you to record without listening. If \"silent\" recording does not work, mute the \"Device\" slider at far left of the Windows \"Volume Mixer\" or plug in speakers or headphones and turn off their volume.    \n** If the achieved loopback recording level is too low, try turning up the volume in the application playing the audio.\n** Adjusting linked sliders during loopback recording may cause audio breakup or recording glitches.   \n** Loopback recording may fail \"error opening\" when Audacity is set to record in mono.\n** You will normally need to start playing the loopback stream (or to have previously played some other audio in the application you are using for playback) before starting loopback recording in Audacity. \n** Changing Default Format or Exclusive Mode settings in [[Mixer_Toolbar_Issues#vistacp|Windows Sound]] while Audacity is open may cause \"error opening\" when starting to play or record. Try Transport > Rescan Audio Devices or restarting Audacity.\n** If you receive dropouts or poor quality when recording, try setting the Audacity [https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/selection_toolbar.html Project Rate] to 44100 Hz and setting Default Format in Windows Sound to 44100 Hz, with both \"Exclusive Mode\" boxes ''unchecked''. Other rates may work, providing the same rate is set in both places. The most likely place for a dropout is within the first second or two of recording. \n** Physical inputs may fail \"error opening\", especially when overdub recording. Try setting Audacity project rate to 44100 Hz then for both the playback and the recording device in Windows Sound, ensure both \"Exclusive Mode\" are ''checked'' (enabled). You can also try setting Audacity Project Rate to the same as Windows \"Default Format\" with both Exclusive Mode boxes ''unchecked.'' \n** Latency when overdubbing may substantially increase shortly after starting the recording.  \n** \"Audio to buffer\" in Recording Preferences cannot be used to adjust recording latency.\n** Non-looped playback plays the selection minus the \"Audio to buffer\" (for example, standard playback may fail to play the buffered length at the end of the selection). Setting the buffer setting to zero when using WASAPI host may make it more likely that audio will play fully."

'''Workarounds:''' Configure Audacity with --disable-dynamic-loading. If dynamic loading is required, build against FFmpeg instead of libav, or you can build against libav if you remove the \"#define IS_FFMPEG_PROJECT 1\" line in src/FFmpeg.h.\n** Audacity may still build against no-longer-supported FFmpeg versions (such as FFmpeg 0.8 which is system-installed on Debian Wheezy), but configuring with --disable-dynamic-loading will be necessary. FFmpeg 0.8 has at least one known issue in Audacity 2.0.6 or later: mono WMA files export with no audio data. This issue will not be fixed given FFmpeg 0.8 is no longer supported by Audacity 2.0.6.   \n** Building against self-compiled FFmpeg 2.2.2 with --disable-dynamic-loading the only argument fails on Ubuntu 13.10 with \"undefined reference to 'av_codec_is_encoder'\". '''Workaround:''' Configuring with --disable-dynamic-loading and --with-lib-preference=\"local\" (or at least  --with-ffmpeg=\"local\") may build successfully, but may not disable Libraries Preferences.

    "Release Note": "GROUP:Bugs requiring more investigation\n* (Windows) Some devices that used to offer multiple recording channels in Audacity without ASIO may now only offer mono or stereo recording instead of the expected number of channels. Usually the multi or similar device only has 2 channels instead of the expected number. Occasionally the multi device is missing, leaving only two-channel devices to choose from. These devices have been reported:\n** Alesis Multimix-8 USB\n** DSP2000-CPort\n** M-Audio Delta 66\n** Motu 896 AD/DA FW\n** Tascam US 1641 and US 1800\n<ul style=\"list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none\">\nIf you experience this issue please report make and model number of the device, your operating system (for example, Windows 7 Service Pack 1) and the device driver version number you are using. It is possible that more than stereo recording may be possible if you can find earlier drivers that are still compatible with your version of Windows, or if you try the Windows WASAPI host in [https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/device_toolbar.html Device Toolbar]. See [https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Multichannel_Recording Multichannel Recording] for a list of devices reported to record multi-channels into Audacity without ASIO.</ul>"

'''Workaround:''' Before recording the first track in a session, click \"Pause\" then \"Record\" to enable the recording meter.\n** The best way to connect to available JACK inputs and outputs is directly from Device Toolbar. Use Transport > Rescan Audio Devices when necessary, for example to make new JACK applications ports available to Audacity. See [[Linux Issues#JACK|here]] for details.  \n** On Mac, Audacity may freeze if JACK is launched by QjackCtl then Audacity is launched.

    "Release Note": "GROUP:Accessibility\n* Many, but not all parts of the Audacity interface are accessible on Windows and Mac (''read the alert above about Mac'') to those who can't use a mouse, and/or use a screen reader. It may be possible to make more of Audacity accessible in the longer term. For details, see https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/accessibility.html \n* '''There are some accessibility bugs in the parts of Audacity that are accessible (or behavior may vary according to the specific screen reader).''' \n** After mouse down to drag a docked toolbar to a new docked or undocked position, the track focus is removed and the selected control loses its focus border even though that toolbar still has focus. When dragging or resizing an already undocked toolbar, the selected control similarly loses its focus border.      \n** Keyboard Preferences: Window-Eyes doesn't read the key bindings when View by Tree is selected, and may not always read the bindings in other views. VoiceOver and Orca do not read the key bindings at all. You could export the bindings, modify them in a text editor then import the modified list. \n** Spectral Selection Toolbar:  \n*** You can't enter a new low frequency first if it is above the current high frequency - in that case, you must enter the new high frequency first. \n*** If you change low and high frequencies to kHz, then typing or incrementing values in the High Frequencies box has unpredictable results.\n** It is not possible to use the keyboard to move the cursor or selection region to an arbitrary position when playing or recording. However you can use the [ or ] shortcuts respectively to set the left or right boundary of the selection at the playback or recording position ( https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/edit_menu_select.html#left ). Different [https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scrubbing_and_seeking.html Scrubbing] modes may also be started using shortcuts or the Transport Menu, but there is no keyboard interface yet to control scrubbing. Scrubbing may be started by shortcut even if the pointer is in the waveform, although the Status Bar messages don't refer to moving the pointer to Scrub.  \n** '''(Windows):''' \n*** Edit toolbar buttons that depend on selection are (at least in NVDA) announced as Disabled when there is no selection, rather than being skipped over. Hitting ENTER on such a disabled button will auto-select the audio, applying the edit to all of that automatic selection.  \n*** In certain parts of the main window, NVDA does not speak typed characters (JAWS and Window-Eyes are not affected):\n*** In the main window, not speaking a character if it is a command for example, j,k,[ or ]\n*** In a label track, not speaking characters typed into a label.\n** '''(OS X/macOS):'''\n*** Audacity is not yet fully Retina-ready. It is known that the Track Control Panel appears fuzzy. Please [https://www.audacityteam.org/contact/#feedback let us know] of any other issues. [http://retinizer.mikelpr.com/ Retinizer] can no longer be applied to Audacity. If Retinizer is applied to previous Audacity this will prevent the export format being changed. \n*** '''Selection is not in the first control of Generators, Effects or Analyzers.''' In most effects the selection is invisible and one TAB puts selection in the Manage Button. In Change Speed the selection is \"Current Length\" and in Change Pitch the selection is the first octave.  \n*** If you apply a real-time preview effect while focus has remained in Audacity, the effect loses focus. If you apply a real-time preview effect after task switching away from and back to Audacity, the effect will go behind the project window. The effect may be brought back to focus in both cases with ALT + F6. \n*** It is not possible to move between the main Audacity window and some VST and Audio Unit effects using the ALT + F6 or ALT + SHIFT + F6 shortcuts when the effect is in Graphical Mode. You can use the \"Manage\" menu then Options... to change the effect to textual mode.    \n** '''(OS X/macOS) Issues with VoiceOver:'''\n<ul>{{advice|Unfortunately, current Audacity is not accessible for users of VoiceOver for the reasons given below. This was also the case for releases starting from Audacity 2.1.1. However, an accessible version of Audacity 2.1.1 is available on our [http://audacityteam.org/download/mac Mac OS X downloads page]. The name of this accessible version is \"2.1.1-screen-reader\" (DMG and ZIP downloads are available). It is hoped that future versions of Audacity will be accessible for users of VoiceOver.}}\n<ul><ul><li> (reported on OS X 10.9.x) After exporting, the black accessibility area is trapped in the Tooldock area, so there is no way to read the tracks. '''Workaround:''' Save as a project, close the project then reopen it. You can then navigate the tracks with VoiceOver.\n<li> If you use arrow keys to navigate the Timetext controls in Selection Toolbar, VoiceOver stops reading. '''Workaround:''' Use Control-Option-W \n<li> When you TAB forwards from \"Audio Position\" in Selection Toolbar, the \"Selection End\" or \"Selection Length\" radio button is read as \"Selection Start\". When you use COMMAND + F6 or COMMAND + SHIFT + F6 to move directly into \"Selection End\" from another toolbar, the button is read as \"Selection Start\". \n<li> Mixer Toolbar input/output sliders are not read, but just described as \"multiple indicators\". The \"Graphic EQ\"  and vertical sliders in Equalization *are* read.\n<li> Metadata Editor table not read.\n<li> Edit Labels dialog not read.\n<li> In the \"Edit Chains\" window, only the first command in the \"Chain\" list is read, and it is only read when first accessed. In the \"Select Command\" window for inserting a new command in a Chain, commands in the table are not read.\n<li> \"Manage Curves\" table in Equalization not read.</ul>\n<li>\n'''GNU/Linux:'''\n<ul><li>(Linux Ubuntu) Under Unity, keyboard shortcuts are not visible in the Audacity menus. Keyboard shortcuts are visible if you install the classic [http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/install-gnome-classic-desktop-in-ubuntu-14-04/ GNOME Flashback] interface or under Unity if you open Audacity from the termimal with {{code|1=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 audacity}}\nAudacity will now ship with src/audacity.desktop.in set to UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 so Audacity compiled from source will show shortcuts in the menus and will have its own menu bar in the application. It will remain up to Ubuntu whether they use this desktop file in packaged versions of Audacity.    \n<li> Access keys mostly do not work except for radio buttons and checkboxes.  \n<li> (Linux with Xfce desktop) It is not possible to move forward through modeless windows, undocked Toolbars and the main project window using ALT + F6. You may move backward using ALT + SHIFT + F6, but focus may get trapped in windows or undocked toolbars.\n<li> (Linux) '''It is not possible to TAB through the search box in Keyboard Preferences.''' However, as long as the \"Tree\" or \"Name\" button is selected, you can use DOWN arrow to move out of the Search box into the list, then TAB into the lower controls. \n<li>(Linux) '''Playing or recording then stopping causes the currently focused track or tooldock area to lose focus.''' Some shortcuts for example those for Tools Toolbar will then not work until focus is restored. '''Workaround:''' To restore focus, deliver a mouse click in the interface or create a shortcut for Reset Toolbars and use that shortcut. \n<li>(Linux) TAB unexpectedly navigates out of the current tooldock area instead of staying inside it, and CTRL + F6 from Selection Toolbar and SHIFT + CTRL + F6 from the Tracks table do not navigate to the upper tooldock area but leave focus in the previous toolbar. However you can use the TAB navigation behavior described above to access the upper tooldock area. \n<li> (Linux) The shortcut to \"Move backward from toolbars to tracks\" does not cycle from the audio track to upper tooldock, only to Selection Toolbar. The shortcut to \"Move forward from toolbars to tracks\" does not cycle from Selection Toolbar to upper tooldock, only to the audio track.</ul>\n<li> '''(Linux) Issues with Orca:''' \n<ul><li> Audacity tracks are not read. \n<li> Not all toolbar controls are read, examples being Timetext controls, Project Rate and controls in Device Toolbar.\n<li> Not all controls in Preferences are read.\n<li> Control labels for VAMP and VST plugins are not read.\n<li> Control labels for Nyquist plugins are read inconsistently in older version 3 or earlier plugins (Version 4 seems to read more consistently).</ul></ul></ul>"
