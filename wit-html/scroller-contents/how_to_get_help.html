<p>Many questions have been asked before, and you can obtain your answer just by searching! Look for the Search box top right of any Forum page, and enter some general words that relate to your question, separated by spaces. For example if you are recording from a USB turntable and cannot hear the records in Audacity, try entering:
</p>
<pre>USB  turntable  hear  records

\label{how:to:get:help:post}-->
<p>Please post your question to the particular Forum that corresponds to your <!--\textbf{--><b>computer operating system and version of Audacity</b><!--}--> (for example, Audacity 2.x for Windows). This makes it much easier for us to help you. Click the "New Topic" button top left, then submit your question. 
</p><p>By default you will be subscribed to the topic you created and will receive an email when someone replies to you.

<!--
\subsection{--><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Audacity-users_mailing_list">Audacity-users mailing list</span></h2><!--}--><!--latex 
\label{how:to:get:help:list}-->
<p>This is another place where Audacity users can get together, learn about our application, share tips and ask questions. The difference here is that this a mailing list, meaning you usually send messages to the list by email using your email application. You will also receive an email every time any other list member makes a post. Sometimes there can be a lot of emails if an interesting topic is started! To reduce the number of emails, you can always subscribe in "digest" mode, which combines each day's messages into one large email. 
</p><p>If you only want to ask a question every now and then, the Forum may suit you better. 
</p>
<div id="subscribe"></div>
<!--
\subsubsection{--><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_subscribe">How to subscribe</span></h3><!--}--><!--latex 
\label{how:to:get:help:subscribe}-->
<p>Go to the <a class="external text" href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-users" rel="nofollow">list information page</a>. Fill out the subscription information half way down the page. You will be sent an email requesting confirmation. This is only so as to stop others signing you up when you do not want to. Click the confirmation link in the email to subscribe and start receiving emails.

<div class="note"><!--\textbf{--><b>Note:</b><!--}--> This is a public mailing list - messages are seen by all list subscribers, and posted on several websites where the messages are archived. </div>

\subsubsection{--><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Searching_for_an_answer">Searching for an answer</span></h3><!--}--><!--latex

<p>You can sometimes find an answer quickly by going to the <a class="external text" href="http://audacity.238276.n2.nabble.com/audacity-users-f238277.html" rel="nofollow">Nabble archive</a> of the list and finding a similar topic to yours.

<p>This list is essentially one large collection of individual messages. Each message on this same topic is a "thread", which keeps messages on the same subject together. So if you ask questions here, please <!--\textbf{--><b>give us the following information.</b><!--}--> You'll get your answer much quicker that way.   
</p>
<!--
\begin{itemize}--><ul><!--
\item --><li> Give the subject of your message a descriptive title that summarises your problem - "No sound in iTunes after recording from USB microphone" is great; "Help me!!" is not... </li>
<!--
\item --><li> Tell us what computer operating system you are using (for example, Windows 7 or Mac OS X 10.10.1) </li>
<!--
\item --><li> Tell us exactly what version of Audacity you are using (see Help &gt; About Audacity, or Audacity &gt; About Audacity on a Mac computer)</li>
<!--
\item --><li> If this is a recording problem, tell us what equipment you are recording with, and how it's connected to the computer</li></ul><!--

<p>Following these rules helps everyone get the most out of the list, whether searching for an answer or replying to a message:
</p>
<!--
\begin{itemize}--><ul><!--
\item --><li> <!--\textbf{--><b>To start a new topic:</b><!--}--> Choose a new subject and Press "Compose" in your email software to start a completely new email. Please do not take someone else's message with its own subject and content and post your own unrelated material into it. If you must compose a new message by replying to someone else's, at least change the subject and remove all the text from the original message. Note that this still means the online archives of this list will keep the old subject, because they store the header references to the old subject. This makes it very difficult to follow messages online, so please try to compose a new message if you can. </li>
<!--
\item --><li> <!--\textbf{--><b>When replying to a message:</b><!--}-->
<!--
\begin{itemize}--><ul><!--
\item --><li> Don't send a reply which includes a complete copy of the message you are replying to, unless it's really necessary. Retain only those parts of the original message that are relevant to your answer. Otherwise the message becomes too long by the time several people have replied.  </li>
<!--
\item --><li> If you are replying to a digest email, change the subject to that of the individual message from the digest that you are replying to. </li></ul><!--
