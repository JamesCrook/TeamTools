This is the spec for the interactive diagram which shows the structure of the
Ear. There's an [https://wit.audacityteam.org/demos.htm?page=The_Ear interactive demo].

This is one of three related pages.  The other two are:

<em><p>The ossicles are tiny bones that transmit sound from the tympanic membrane to the oval window.  Muscles can [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex tighten and slacken] so as to make this system for transmitting sound more or less sensitive.</p></em>

<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea Cochlea]</h1>
<em><p>The Cochlea is a spiral shaped organ that has standing waves of sound in it.  The spiral shape is relevant to its ability to sensitively sense different frequencies of sound.</p></em>

<h1>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_window Oval Window]</h1><em><p>The oval window is a membrane that transmits vibrations in the ossicles to the fluid in the inner ear.  It is oval rather than round, so that it transmits all relevant frequencies.  Were it round, there would be characteristic frequencies that it absorbed more than others.</p></em>
